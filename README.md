# Advanced Web Application Project Team 16

The goal of this project was to develop a web-based meal ordering service that was comparable to Wolt or Foodora.

The client and backend applications for the application are completely functional. There are two different user types for the app:
- A customer (or consumer user)
- A manager (or operator of a restaurant)

A customer who wants to order food from a restaurant is referred to as a consumer user. A restaurant manager is a user who has the ability to add new restaurants to the system, manage existing restaurants, design new menus, and handle food orders from customers.
